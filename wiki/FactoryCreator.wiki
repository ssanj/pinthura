== A Simple Example ==

Assume you have a `Square` interface:

{{{
public interface Square {

    int getLength();
    int getArea();
}
}}}

And an implementation:

{{{
public final class SquareImpl implements Square {

    private static final int SIDES_OF_SQUARE = 4;

    private final int length;

    public SquareImpl(final int length) {
        this.length = length;
    }

    public int getLength() {
        return SIDES_OF_SQUARE * length;
    }

    public int getArea() {
        return length * length;
    }
}
}}}

You now want to hide the instantiation of the `SquareImpl` behind a factory interface:

{{{
public interface SquareFactory {

    Square createSquare(int length);
 }
}}}

The `SquareFactory` is used in the `ShapeCanvas`:

{{{
public final class ShapeCanvas {

    private final SquareFactory squareFactory;
    private int canvasArea;

    public ShapeCanvas(final int canvasArea, final SquareFactory squareFactory) {
        this.canvasArea = canvasArea;
        this.squareFactory = squareFactory;
    }

    public int calcSquaresOnCanvas(int size) {
        Square square = squareFactory.create(size);
        int area = square.getArea();
        return canvasArea / area;
    }
}
}}}

The `ShapeCanvas` is run through the `ShapeCanvasRunner`:

{{{
public final class ShapeCanvasRunner {

    public static void main(final String[] args) {
        FactoryCreator factoryCreator = new FactoryCreatorImpl(new InvocationFactoryImpl());
        SquareFactory squareFactory = factoryCreator.create(SquareFactory.class);

        ShapeCanvas canvas = new ShapeCanvas(40, squareFactory);
        System.out.println("Number of squares: " + canvas.calcSquaresOnCanvas(2));
    }
}
}}}

This gives the following output:

{{{
Number of squares: 10
}}}

You have now created an instance of `SquareImpl` which is used in the `ShapeCanvas#calcSquaresOnCanvas` method, without using the `new` keyword or implementing the `SquareFactory` interface.
