#labels FilterChainImpl,ChainofResponsibility
Describes the {{{FilterChainImpl}}} class.

= Introduction =

The {{{FilterChainImpl}}} is an implementation of the (Gof) [http://dofactory.com/Patterns/PatternChain.aspx Chain of Responsibility] pattern. 

The basic premise is, that, one of many handlers, may handle a given input. At runtime each handler will be given a chance to handle the input. If it can't handle the input, it passes it to the next handler in the chain, until a handler is found or all handlers are exhausted.

= Why use the Chain of Responsibility? =

 # Decouples the sender of a request from the object that handles the request.
 # Dynamically updating the chain of handlers for a given request. (no if-else nastiness)


= How {{{FilterChainImpl}}} implements the Chain of Responsibility =

The {{{FilterChainImpl}}} class and the {{{FilterLink}}} interface are used to implement the COR pattern. In this setting the _Handlers_ are called {{{FilterLinks}}}. The {{{FilterChainImpl}}} is initialized through a constructor that takes in a {{{List<FilterLink>}}}. 

*Guidelines for implementing the {{{FilterLink}}} interface*:
 # Each implementation in the List of {{{FilterLink}}}s have to accept the same input and same output types.
 # If the {{{FilterLink}}} can handle the input, it must return the result. 
 # A {{{FilterLink}}} must throw a {{{MatchNotFoundException}}} to indicate it can't handle the input.
 # Each {{{FilterLink}}} will be called multiple times. The state of the {{{FilterLink}}} implementation should remain constant between calls.

*Guidelines for using the {{{FilterChainImpl}}} class*:

 # The {{{FilterChainImpl}}} class is an implementation of the {{{FilterLink}}} interface and may throw a {{{MatchNotFoundException}}} if none of the supplied {{{FilterLink}}}s can handle the input. In such a situation, catching the {{{MatchNotFoundException}}} and rethrowing a more specific exception is encouraged:

Eg.

{{{

try {
  filterChain.filter(fileName);
} catch (MatchNotFoundException e) {
   throw new ConfigFileNotFoundException(e);
}

}}}
